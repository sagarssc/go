Package Main:
    It defines a standalone executable program, not a library. Within Package main the function main is also special
    It is where execution of the program begins.
    Whatever main function does is what the program does

We must tell the compiler what pacakages are needed by the source file, that is the role of the import declaration that follows the pacakge declaration



Loops:

// a traditional for loop
for initialization; condition; post {

}

//a tradition while loop
for condition {

}

// an infinte loop
for {

}

defining Variable

i) x := ""
ii) var x string
iii) var x = ""
iv) var x string = ""

i) first form is short variable declaration, most compact but it may be used only with in a function not for package level variable
ii) Second form relies on the default initialization of the zero value which is "" for string
iii) Third form rarely used except when declaring multiple variable
iv) forth form is explicit about the variable's type, which is redundant when it is same as the initial value but necessary in other cases where they are not of the same type
